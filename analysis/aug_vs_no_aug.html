Dalton and his contemporaries believed those were the fundamental particles of nature and thus named them atoms, after the Greek word "atomos", meaning "indivisible" or "uncut". However, near the end of 19th century, physicists discovered that Dalton's atoms are not, in fact, the fundamental particles of nature, but conglomerates of even smaller particles.
